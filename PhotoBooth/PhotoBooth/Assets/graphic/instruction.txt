at start screen "start.png" when you press the screen it says

READY - and count down from 3 sec and show 3..2..1

When the picture is taken, it show the ok-selfie.png (green tumb) in right side, and the red tumb in left side
If you press the green tumb ig says OK - and go back to main streen where you press to start.
If you press the red tumb it have to re-name the photo with s or put it in a special folder named "deleted" so it still stored, and the app have to go back to READY and start counting 5..4..3..2..1 - for retaking the photo 

So all the picture is stored, buth them where pepole press the red dislike tumb, have to be renamed with a letter first or in a seperately folder.

If theres is no press in 10 sec. it is stored like if they press the green buttom.

In the buttom of the app in left side it have to show logo "app buttom.png"
